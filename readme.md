-model with demonstration:
outgoing pipe with hot water;
incoming pipe with cold water;
temperatures on both sides of connections on each end to measure differences in temperatures

outgoing hot water flows through large pipe connected to heat reservoir (concrete?) - measure temp before and after
incoming cold water flow through thin movable pipe - some sort of heat pump mechanism transfers from heat reservoir to incoming cold water -> need less hot water

has to be small enough to fit under sink
can be incorporated with garbage disposal eventually

possible without any electronics??	

2 sources of energy! flow of water and the heat itself

need to replace the incoming cold anyways
-replace both the incoming cold and hot with extra long tubes - connect those tubes to the block and make the water 
pass as close as possible to the outgoing hot water-
only thing seperating them is very heat conductive wall

for outgoing hot, special pvc pipe:with thin/flat cross section- incoming cold also rerouted just above thing/flat cross section before on to sink
separation layer between in/out water is thin piece of copper that has been treated etc.

thin walled copper pipe, within another pipe. very thin layer between the two for incoming cold to pass through, gets warmed from inner

4 thermometers and 2 flows, one hot one cold. pipe within a pipe. lab condensor for your sink.
could add a rbpi to it.
